This is a command for the [Kakoune text editor](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune). 

It assumes that you have a single selection in the first line of a method or constructor declaration when the command is called. 

It will generate a javadoc comment stub including `@param`, `@throws` and `@return` tags as necessary.
